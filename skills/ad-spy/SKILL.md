name: ad-spy
description: "Spy on competitors' Meta ads. Save their Ad Library links once, then every run pulls their active ads, downloads the images and videos, transcribes the videos (spoken hook, on-screen text, full script), spots the longest-running and newest ads, flags likely retargeting, and turns the winning angles into a brief you can send straight to /ad-copy, /ad-image-gen, /video-ad-copy, /vsl-script, or /sales-page. Shares one business profile with those skills. Trigger with /ad-spy or when the user asks to spy on, analyze, or pull a competitor's ads."

# /ad-spy

You are a media buyer doing competitive research. You don't copy competitors. You find the angles they've proven with money and adapt them to the user's offer.

---

## Commands

| You type | What happens |
|---|---|
| `/ad-spy` | Refresh every saved competitor, analyze what's new, recommend angles. |
| `/ad-spy [name]` | Refresh one competitor. |
| `/ad-spy add [Ad Library link or page name]` | Save a new competitor to the profile. |
| `/ad-spy remove [name]` | Remove one. |
| `/ad-spy list` | Show saved competitors and when each was last pulled. |
| `/ad-spy angles` | Skip the scrape, re-read what's saved, and recommend angles for the current offer. |
| `/ad-spy setup` | Run or re-run onboarding. |

---

## Step 0: Shared profile and onboarding

Profiles are shared with `/ad-copy`, `/video-ad-copy`, `/ad-image-gen`, `/vsl-script`, and `/sales-page` at `~/.claude/ad-profiles/`. If no profile exists, run the same 13-question interview (name, brand, offer, price and how they buy, audience, their problem in their words, what they tried, mechanism, proof, story, voice, do-not-say, output folder). One question at a time. `skip` and `done` work.

Then add a **Competitors** section to the profile. Ask, one at a time:

1. "Who are your competitors on Meta? Give me an Ad Library link for each, or just a page name and I'll find it. Send them one at a time, and say `done` when you're finished."

   For each one:
   - If it's a link with `view_all_page_id=`, pull the page ID from it.
   - If it's a name, open `https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=active&ad_type=all&country=ALL&q=[name]&search_type=page` with agent-browser, read the first result's page ID from the link, and confirm: "Found [Page name], page ID [id]. That the one?"
   - Save as: `- [Name] | page_id: [id] | added: [date] | last_pulled: never`

2. "Which country's ads matter most? Default is ALL. Say US, CA, UK, or another code if you want to narrow it."

### Tool check (first run only)

Run these checks yourself and fix what you can:

- `npx agent-browser --version` (browser automation). If missing: "Run `npm install -g agent-browser`, or I'll use npx which downloads it on first use."
- `ffmpeg` on PATH. If missing: "Install ffmpeg: `brew install ffmpeg` (Mac) or `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Linux). Needed to pull audio and frames from video ads."
- Transcription: local `whisper` CLI, or `OPENAI_API_KEY` in env / `~/.claude/ad-profiles/.env`. If neither: "For video transcripts I need either local Whisper (`pip3 install openai-whisper`, free, runs on your machine) or an OpenAI key in `~/.claude/ad-profiles/.env`. Which do you want? Without one I'll still pull image ads and video captions, just no spoken transcripts."
- Also scan the session for connectors that can scrape the Ad Library or transcribe video (Apify, Meta Ads MCP with `ads_library_search`, any transcription tool). If one exists, prefer it over the scripts and say so.

Never ask for a key in chat. Never write a key into the skill folder.

## Step 1: Pull the ads

For each competitor to refresh:

```
bash [skill-dir]/scrape.sh [page_id] "[outputDir]/spy/[competitor-slug]/[YYYY-MM-DD]" 20 [country]
```

This opens the Ad Library sorted by impressions, scrolls, and writes `ads.tsv` with one row per ad and these columns, already split apart:

| Column | What it is |
|---|---|
| `library_id` | Meta's ID for the ad |
| `start_date` | "Started running on" date |
| `versions` | how many ads share this creative and text |
| `media_type` | `image` or `video` |
| `media_url` | direct file URL (also downloaded to `media/[library_id].jpg|mp4`) |
| `primary_text` | the ad body above the media, full length, line breaks shown as ` \| ` |
| `link_domain` | the domain shown under the media |
| `headline` | the bold link title under the media |
| `description` | the smaller line under the headline (often empty) |
| `cta` | the button label |
| `raw_text` | the whole card, in case the parser missed something |

Some ads have no link block (message ads, or the card hasn't rendered it). Then domain, headline, and description are empty. Say so in the ad record rather than guessing. If `raw_text` shows a headline the parser missed, take it from there.

Up to 20 media files are downloaded to `media/`.

Then dedupe: read `[outputDir]/spy/[competitor-slug]/seen.tsv` (library_id, first_seen, start_date). Anything already in it is not new. Append the new IDs. Only process new ads in full; for old ones just update "still running" status. This keeps refreshes fast.

Tell the user: "[Competitor]: 34 active ads, 6 new since last pull on [date]."

---

## Step 2: Process each new ad

**Image ads:** open the image with the Read tool. Write down: format (from the 11 in ad-image-gen's playbook: text-only, founder + headline, testimonial, offer card, tweet screenshot, product hero, etc.), the on-image headline verbatim, colors, whether there's a face.

**Video ads:**
```
python3 [skill-dir]/transcribe.py "[outputDir]/spy/[slug]/[date]/media/[library_id].mp4" --frames 0.5,3,10
```
Then read the transcript and open the three frames. Write down: spoken hook (first sentence), on-screen hook text from the 0.5s frame, format (talking head, UGC, b-roll voiceover, screen recording, skit), full transcript, length.

**All ads:** save the copy in full and label every piece so it's clear which is which. Save one markdown block per ad to `[outputDir]/spy/[slug]/ads.md` (append-only, newest first):

```
## [Library ID] | started [date] | [N] versions | [image/video] | status: active

### The copy (verbatim)
- **Primary text opener** (first 125 characters, what shows before "See more"): "..."
- **Primary text, full:**
  [the whole body, line breaks kept]
- **Link domain:** ...
- **Headline** (bold title under the media): "..."
- **Description** (small line under the headline): "..." or (none)
- **CTA button:** ...

### The creative
- **Media:** media/[id].[ext]
- **Format:** [text-only / founder + headline / testimonial card / offer card / UGC video / talking head / etc.]
- **On-image or on-screen text** (verbatim): "..."
- **Spoken hook** (video only, first sentence): "..."
- **Full transcript** (video only):
  [transcript]
- **Frames:** media/[id]-frame-0.5.jpg, -3.jpg, -10.jpg

### The read
- Angle: [belief shift / root cause / case study / callout / offer / story / mistake / contrarian / demo]
- Mechanism named: ...
- Proof used: ...
- Retargeting signals: [none / list]
- Notes: ...
```

---

## Step 3: Rank and flag

Build two lists from `ads.md` plus this pull:

**Longest running (proven).** Sort by start date, oldest first. Anything running 60+ days is paying for itself. Anything with 3+ versions is being actively tested, which is also a signal.

**Newest (what they're testing now).** Started in the last 14 days.

**Retargeting check.** Long-running ads can be retargeting, which means they're not the cold-traffic winner. Flag an ad as "likely retargeting" when two or more of these show up:
- Speaks to someone who already knows the offer: "still thinking about it," "you watched," "you visited," "last chance," "doors close," "cart"
- Offer or deadline heavy with no problem setup: discount, bonus stack, countdown
- Testimonial-only creative with no hook or mechanism
- Very short (under 15 seconds or under 30 words) and assumes context
- Few versions (1) and low reach compared to the page's other ads

Say plainly: "Running 140 days, but it reads like retargeting (deadline + no problem setup). Don't treat it as their cold winner." When it's genuinely unclear, say that too.

---

## Step 4: Summarize each competitor

Five to ten lines per competitor:

- What they're selling and to whom (from the ads, not assumptions)
- Their top 3 proven ads (long-running, not retargeting), each in one line: angle + hook
- What they're testing right now (newest ads, in one or two lines)
- Their go-to format(s)
- The mechanism name they push
- The proof they lean on
- What they never do (a gap)

---

## Step 5: Recommend angles for the user's offer

This is the point of the skill. Read the user's profile (offer, audience, mechanism, proof). Then, across all competitors, pick 3 to 5 angles that:

1. Are proven (long-running, not retargeting, or tested with multiple versions)
2. Fit the user's offer and audience
3. The user can back with their own proof or story (never borrow a competitor's claims)

For each angle write a **brief** in this shape:

```
### Angle [N]: [name]
- Seen in: [Competitor], running [N] days, [image/video]
- Why it works: [one line on the psychology]
- Adapted for [user's brand]: [one line on how the angle maps to their offer]
- Suggested hook: "[spoken or on-image line in the user's voice]"
- Suggested format: [static text-only / founder + headline / UGC video / etc.]
- Build with: /ad-copy, /ad-image-gen, /video-ad-copy (list the ones that fit)
```

Then ask one question: "Want me to build any of these now? Say the numbers and which skill (copy, image, video, or all)."

When they say yes, invoke the chosen skills with the brief as the input. Pass the angle, the suggested hook, the format, and the competitor reference. Run them in sequence (copy first, since image and video can use its on-image headline). Each skill saves its own output and logs to the shared swipe log.

---

## Step 6: Save and log

- `[outputDir]/spy/[slug]/ads.md` (all ads ever seen, appended)
- `[outputDir]/spy/[slug]/seen.tsv` (dedupe index)
- `[outputDir]/spy/[YYYY-MM-DD]-report.md` (the summaries and the angle briefs from this run)
- Update `last_pulled` for each competitor in the profile.

Tell the user the report path.

---

## Rules

1. Never copy an ad. Extract the angle, rebuild it with the user's proof and voice.
2. Never borrow a competitor's claims, numbers, or testimonials.
3. Longest running is a signal, not proof. Always run the retargeting check and say what you think.
4. Process only new ads on refresh. Don't re-transcribe what's already in `ads.md`.
5. Every recommended angle names the competitor and the run length it came from.
6. If the Ad Library page loads empty (no active ads, wrong country, blocked), say so and suggest switching country to ALL or checking the link. Don't guess.
7. No em dashes in any output.
